<h3>Column Widths</h3>

<p>These are the widths of your 3-column layout (to use
    2 columns, simply enter 0 as the width for the left
    or right column).</p>
<p>You may enter a number followed by a % or em or any appropriate styling unit. Numbers with no
units will be defaulted to px. If you want px do not put px after the value let the number default
to px.</p>
