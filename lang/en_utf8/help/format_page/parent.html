<h3>Select Parent Page</h3>

<p>If this is the first page in your course you will see a
    "There are no potential parent pages" message. When you create
    other pages, you can set them to be child pages in this setting.
    Child pages appear indented underneath Parent pages and a Parent
    page must be clicked on to view the child pages.</p>
