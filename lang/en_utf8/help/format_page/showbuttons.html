<h3>Previous and Next Links</h3>

<p>Choose whether or not to show buttons that automatically link to the Previous
    Page and/or the Next Page in the current set of pages (child pages that are
    linked from a particular master page). The Previous and Next buttons can
    help users navigate through your course, they are especially useful if you
    have large numbers of pages, or long pages.</p>
